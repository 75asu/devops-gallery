# devops-gallery

## This repo contains multiple DevOps projects that I built  folowing different resources to upskill my knowledge in different DevOps tools

This setup is automated, repeatable and has IaC(Infrastructure as Code) to reduce the hassle of setting up and environment with different scenarios.

Tools used to prepare the Sandbox Environment to hold the setup are

- Hypervisor : Oracle VirtualBox
- Automation : Vagrant
- CLI : Git Bash
- IDE : VS Code
